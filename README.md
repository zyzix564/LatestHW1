# Challenge 1: Enhancing a Webpage's Accessibility!
---
In this challenge, I refactored existing code in order to enhance the accessibility of a client's webpage.

## Purpose
---
Enhancing the accessibility of webpages is important not only as a moral imperative, but it's also good for business! More accessibility means more business and that means potentially more moolah/frogskins/dinero/greenbacks/baksheesh/money!

## Specifics of Work Performed
---
I made the following changes to the client's webpage:

1. I changed various ``<div>`` elements into semantic elements for enhanced screen reader comprehension.
2. I made sure all elements, including headers, followed logical sequence.
3. I added ``alt`` attributes to images and icons in order to deliver information about said images and icons to those with impaired eyesight.
4. I added a descriptive title to the webpage whereas before there was none.

### _Fun Fact!_: The term "div soup" describes code that uses many ``<div>`` elements inside one another instead of semantically differentiating the various elements. That doesn't give us very specific information about a webpage's layout  does it?! What a drag!
